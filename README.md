# Hi there 👋, I'm Matias Alfonso.

## Looking for my first job as Web Developer.

💪 I'm currently learning React Native and making some MERN projects to get better as a dev.

🧑‍💻 I learned so many different languages ​​and tools, but I mainly use:

● HTML,
● CSS,
● JavaScript,
● MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).

🎀 I'm also interested in UI Design, so I try to make good looking designs in my websites, designing first on Figma.
