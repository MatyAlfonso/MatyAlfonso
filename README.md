# Hi there 👋, I'm Matias Alfonso.

### Looking for my first job as Web Developer.

💪 I'm currently learning React Native and making some MERN projects to get better as a dev.

🧑‍💻 I learned so many different languages ​​and tools, but I mainly use:

● HTML, <br />
● CSS, <br />
● JavaScript, <br />
● MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). <br />

🎀 I'm also interested in UI Design, so I try to make good looking designs in my websites, designing first on Figma. 

🕹️ As a hobby, I like to play video games, watch series and movies, listen to music, and make some photos and videos and edit them.
